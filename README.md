# Network Security Threats – Research Report

## 1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack

**➤ Description:**  
A DoS attack attempts to make a machine or network resource unavailable to users by overwhelming it with traffic.

**➤ Impact:**  
- Service disruption  
- Loss of business continuity  
- Increased server costs  

**➤ Real-world Example:**  
In 2016, a major DDoS attack targeted Dyn DNS provider, affecting Twitter, Reddit, GitHub, and Netflix.

**➤ Mitigation:**  
- Use anti-DDoS protection (like Cloudflare)  
- Configure firewalls and rate limits  
- Monitor traffic patterns

## 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack

**➤ Description:**  
An attacker secretly intercepts or alters communication between two parties without them knowing.

**➤ Impact:**  
- Sensitive data theft (passwords, bank details)  
- Unauthorized access  
- Session hijacking  

**➤ Real-world Example:**  
Attackers can create fake public Wi-Fi hotspots to steal login information.

**➤ Mitigation:**  
- Use HTTPS and SSL/TLS  
- Use VPN for public networks  
- Enable multi-factor authentication

## 3. Spoofing Attack

**➤ Description:**  
Spoofing means pretending to be someone or something else to gain unauthorized access.

**➤ Types of Spoofing:**  
- IP Spoofing  
- Email Spoofing  
- ARP Spoofing  

**➤ Real-world Example:**  
Attackers send fake emails pretending to be from banks to steal personal info.

**➤ Mitigation:**  
- Use email verification methods (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
- Implement intrusion detection systems  
- Secure communication protocols
